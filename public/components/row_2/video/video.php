    <!-- 
      I'm not sure how you would want to integrate the video 
      I would assume the easiest way is to do it via an iFrame 
      I styled the vid to look similar to Roman's, just need 
      a way to implement the vid through your end, maybe you 
      can show me how to do this as well
